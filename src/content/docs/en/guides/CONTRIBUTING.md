## How to Contribute

2. Open a new issue with the title "Bug: [Descriptive Title]" and provide a detailed description.

### Proposing Features

### Introducing new features

We would Love your contribution to Moss, but we would also like to make sure Moss is as great as possible. Before
introducing a new pull request,

1. Create a new branch on your fork for your new feature: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2. Make your changes and commit them following the commit message guidelines.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate the versioning and release
process. Your commit messages should follow
the [Conventional Commits](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release) specification.

### Semantic Release Format

-   **feat**: A new feature
-   **fix**: A bug fix
-   **docs**: Documentation only changes
-   **perf**: A code change that improves performance
-   **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
-   **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
-   **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
-   **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
-   **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Example Commit Messages

-   **feat:** add user authentication module
-   **fix:** resolve issue with data fetching in dashboard
-   **docs:** update contributing guidelines
-   **style:** format code according to eslint rules
-   **refactor:** simplify data processing logic
-   **perf:** improve query performance
-   **test:** add tests for user service
-   **build:** update npm dependencies
-   **ci:** configure Travis CI for automated testing
-   **chore:** clean up old configuration files
-   **revert:** revert "feat: add user authentication module"

## Submitting a pull request

The branch name is your first opportunity to give your task context. Branch naming convention is as follows,

`<TYPE>-<ISSUE_ID>-<DESCRIPTION>`

It is recommended to combine the relevant [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/keenawa-co/moss/issues) with a short
description that describes the task resolved in this branch. If you don't have GitHub issue for your PR, then you may
avoid the prefix, but keep in mind that more likely you have to create the issue first. For example:

```
feat-123-add-user-authentication-module
```

Where `TYPE` can be any of the types discussed in the [Semantic Release Format](#semantic-release-format)

## Commit your changes

-   **Write a descriptive summary:** The first line of your commit message should be a concise summary of the changes you
    are making. It should be no more than 50 characters and should describe the change in a way that is easy to
    understand.

-   **Provide more details in the body:** The body of the commit message should provide more details about the changes you
    are making. Explain the problem you are solving, the changes you are making, and the reasoning behind those changes.

-   **Use the commit history in your favour:** Small and self-contained commits allow the reviewer to see exactly how you
    solved the problem. By reading the commit history of the PR, the reviewer can already understand what they'll be
    reviewing, even before seeing a single line of code.

## Create a pull request

-   The **title** of your pull request should be clear and descriptive. It should summarize the changes you are making in
    a concise manner.

-   Provide a detailed **description** of the changes you are making. Explain the reasoning behind the changes, the
    problem it solves, and the impact it may have on the codebase. Keep in mind that a reviewer was not working on your
    task, so you should explain why you wrote the code the way you did.

-   Describe the scene and provide everything that will help to understand the background and a context for the reviewers
    by adding related [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/keenawa-co/moss/issues) to the description, and links to the
    related PRs, projects or third-party documentation. If there are any potential drawbacks or trade-offs to your
    changes, be sure to mention them too.

-   Be sure to request reviews from the appropriate people. This might include the project maintainers, other
    contributors, or anyone else who is familiar with the codebase and can provide valuable feedback.

## Code Review Process

1. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.
2. Ensure that all checks pass.
3. A maintainer will review your pull request. Feedback will be provided for any necessary changes.
4. Once approved, your pull request will be merged.
